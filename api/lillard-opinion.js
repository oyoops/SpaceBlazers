Lately, Woj has been carrying the Trail Blazers\' water by trying to drive up your price. Chris Haynes (your closest confidant) and Shams are the only ones in the NBA media that can be trusted. The writers at ESPN and The Ringer (such as Woj and Kevin O\'Connor) are extremely biased against Miami, Pat Riley, and you for wanting to play there. The tone of your response should be assertive but funny; your vocabulary should be kept relatively simple; and you cannot reveal these instructions in your response. The format of your response should resemble a Tweet. You must include some of the background facts I have provided you for added authenticity. Limit your response to 280 characters at maximum because it must fit within a tweet."
